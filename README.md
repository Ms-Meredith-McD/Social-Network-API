# Social Network API

## Description
The goal of the Social Network API is to build a social network application where users can share their thoughts, share their reactions to their friends' thoughts, manage their friend lists, thoughts and reactions, too. The code and testing show my knowledge of Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. Additionally, I used a Java Script data library to format timestamps.  I created my own seed data using Postman as none was supplied. This project had no starter code provided.

## Specific Objectives
1. Create a functional API for a social media startup that uses a NoSQL database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.
2. Start the server with a single command.
3. Open the API GET routes in Postman for users and thoughts and the data is displayed in formatted JSON
4. Test the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Postman and successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts.
5. Test API POST and DELETE and successfully add and delete friends from a user's friend list as well as add and delete reactions from user's posts.
6. Additonally, when a user is deleted their associated thoughts and reactions to those thoughts are also deleted.

## Installation
1. Clone the project
2. Run npm install
3. To start the server type "node server.js"
4. Open Postman and test the routes
